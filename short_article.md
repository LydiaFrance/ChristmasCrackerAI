# Can I teach AI to make Cracker Jokes?

As well as working in AI and Data Science, I am an improv comedian and make up puns and jokes on the spot on stage using audience suggestions. I asked my colleague Fede Nanni who is an expert in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and comedians at The Oxford Imps to help me with teaching ChatGPT to make Christmas Cracker jokes.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT, released for preview just last week by OpenAI, is an NLP model and AI which makes text in a way that seems very human.

We can use Cracker Jokes to test ChatGPT's ability to generate text that is similar to human text, and to explore what is so human about puns!

## Does ChatGPT know any Christmas Cracker jokes?

If you ask ChatGPT for Christmas Cracker style jokes, it is immediately able to give a few good examples, for instance:

Most of these look great! The ability for it to tell jokes like this was beyond the scope of AI until very recently. However, I think I have heard one of those before....

ChatGPT was trained on huge datasets of human text, and so while it is impressive, the AI is like a child repeating a joke they have heard from their parents.

Something lots of people have noticed is that ChatGPT is often very confidently incorrect, where it can justify why a joke is funny and yet is completely wrong:

It seems it is parroting jokes it doesn't understand.

## Can ChatGPT make new jokes?

With a more specific topic, ChatGPT tries to make new jokes:

However, these are funny but they are not jokes. Comedians would call these **anti jokes**. 

Here is a human example of an anti-joke:

`Why did the penguin miss the party?`

`Because it was dead.`

ChatGPT is able to make anti jokes accidentally by producing nonsense sentences. However, it is more like we're laughing at the AI rather than with it.

## Can we teach ChatGPT to make new jokes?


I often teach new improv performers to make up puns on the spot so I can try and teach ChatGPT using the same method. 

ChatGPT can learn new information and tasks within a single session.

ChatGPT struggles with this as it was not trained on how words *sound*. I will help it out on this step by picking its best answers.

As ChatGPT learns within a session, it is able to learn from its mistakes and improve and apply it to a new example:

## How Human are these Jokes?

Now to compare ChatGPT to human performance. Rather than test well known jokes, I asked my fellow performers from [The Oxford Imps](theoxfordimps.com) to produce improvised Christmas Cracker jokes.

We created a quiz for people to guess whether a joke was created by a human or by ChatGPT (both coached and uncoached).

## Human vs AI Humour

Here are the results:



It was clear ChatGPT's improvised jokes do not pass the Turing Test. However, when it was coached some of its examples were just as good as a human improviser. Finally, jokes with "dual meaning" are easier to spot as human. 

So it is possible for ChatGPT to make puns that sound human... with some help!

## Dehumanisation

An interesting result is that one of the jokes was consistently rated as being from ChatGPT, even though it was a human joke.

This was one of ***my jokes***, and so it seems having spent the last few weeks teaching GPT-3 and ChatGPT, they have also taught me to make jokes that sound like AI.

Another one of my jokes was voted the most human, so I haven't completely lost my humanity (yet).

## Conclusion and Final word from ChatGPT

AI is most successful when it collaborates with a human. This is becoming more common in the field of AI, where humans and AI work together to create new things.

Now I will let ChatGPT conclude this article:


> In conclusion, while AI can generate puns and jokes, it simply repeats jokes it has heard before rather than coming up with new ones. It also produces "anti-jokes" which are funny because they are nonsense, rather than clever. Humans, on the other hand, can use their advanced language skills and understanding of wordplay to create original and funny jokes. This shows that while AI has made progress in this area, it still has a long way to go before it can match the creativity and humor of humans.
